		<h2>About Laptop Parts</h2>
		<p>Laptop Parts is on a mission to save as many usable computers from the recycle stream for as long as possible. If a computer is still usable at some level why should it be destroyed? This to us seems to be a waist of resources. On top of that most of the recycled scrap in america goes to china. Why you may ask? Because the EPA doesn't exist to a greater degree over there. Hence it is much easier for them to extract all the Precious metals from the scrap. Because of this good working Computers Get destroyed everyday just to feed the scrap industry. We are not scrappers We are repurposes. We want to take all the good usable equipment and find good homes for them.</p>
