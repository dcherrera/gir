  My hope for the project is to create an open source content managment system that is a little more straight forward in application development and can be as simple as droping an index file in the apropriate aplicataion folder or as complicated as dropping an entire inventory managment system in. I origionaly wrote it in linear php since thats how I origionaly learned PHP when I was 16. But after a many issues with the inlcude functions of php I started wondering if PHP had anymore Object Oriented capabilitys. when i discovered php could be object oriented I abbandoned the project for a later date....well the later date is hear. I'm only uploading to git because at the moment I am down sizing and have been looking for another place to store my code. if you find any of my code usefull (unlikely). feel free to use it. some credit would be nice. I tend to sign my hand writen work with a 0 so putting in a comment at the end of my code would be apriciated and leting my know it was actualy usefull would make me even happier.

The plans for this project
since I have moved all my servers out of my house onto virtual hosted servers i would like to write in a terminal shell and some apps for server managment with digital ocean. but first things first

1. convert the entire code base to OOPHP.
2. set up a new authentication system since I feal mine is wofully lacking...granted I had it running on a site for over a year and to my knowlegde noone with nefariose intent cracked into it. I feal it could still use much more work.
3. perfect the front and backend to make adding applications as simple as possible.
4. I want to operate on the keep it simple stupid priciple. this manly just has to be a secure portal for people to download and use and then build in and on. an empty slate or a full plater. whichever they choose.
